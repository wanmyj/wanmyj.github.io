# Nignx: config SSL link for the port service of NAT internal network server

My home network has only one public IP address and this address's ports `80` and `443` are **blocked**, so all home devices need to connect to the internet via the NAT service of router.   
This public IP address has already dynamically configured the public domain `example.com` through `ddclient`.   
The home server is located in the internal network and provides network services on port `4000` using nginx as the front-end proxy.   
The router has already configured the connection from the public port `8080` to the internal home server port `80` and from the public port `8443` to the internal home server port `443`.

Nginx service is running on the home server. The scenario I want to achieve is:

1. when accessing the home server service through IP in *(or out of if port forwarding is enable on route)* the internal network, an SSL connection is not required, 
1. but when accessing the home server service through the domain name, an SSL connection is required.
1. client makes HTTP request to nginx which is redirect to the same URL with same port but over HTTPS
2. nginx proxies request over HTTP to the backend address with specified port **according to the requested URL**
3. nginx receives response from backend over HTTP.
4. nginx passes this back to the client over HTTPS

for example:
* if the service is accessed by `serverInternalIP:4000`, no SSL needed
* if someone is accessing `example.com:8080`, an SSL connection needed, return `homepage`
* if someone is accessing `service.example.com:8080`, an SSL connection needed, return home server service on port `4000`
